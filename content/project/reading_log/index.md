This project is a visualization of all the books I read in 2020. It is interactive, and allows the user to read my review of each book by selecting an icon on the chart at the top. Selecting an icon will also highlight the bookâ€™s page count in the bar graph.

I used a web-scraping program based in R to scrape the GoodReads.com website for page numbers for all of the books.

### Highlights
